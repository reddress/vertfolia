Basic Form:
Assets = Liabilites + Equity

Equity = Contributed capital + Retained earnings

Retained earnings = Net income - Dividends

Net income = Income - Expenses

Substituting:
Assets = Liabilites + Contributed capital + Income - Expenses - Dividends

Assets + Expenses + Dividends = Liabilites + Contributed capital + Income

Assume Dividends = 0 and rename Contributed capital as Equity
