for example, distinguish between amount spent and received when choosing WAL

Currency corresponds to a model, but all having DecimalField with 2 decimal
places. Conversion must be done outside models

Every account has a parent, root account is the user's name whose parent is
null

First, find ancestors naively (check if parent corresponds to account queried)

Use Ajax to avoid page reloads (Dajax?)

Accounts have multiple subaccounts and any number of transactions

Accounts have a sign modifier (liabilities, equity and income are -1)

heitor (1) +- assets (1) +-
						 +-
		   +- expenses (1)
		   +- income (-1) +- juros (-1)
